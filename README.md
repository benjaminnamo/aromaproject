This repository contains the group project for the Computer Science 3307A: Object-Oriented Design and Analysis class. Our project introduces an innovative approach to learning through the use of olfactory cues. By integrating scent with traditional flashcard memorization techniques, we aim to enhance memory retention and recall, providing a multisensory learning experience.
